# ðŸ“Š Employee Dashboard â€“ Erajaya Technical Test

This repository contains the completed solution for the **Erajaya Group Technical Test**. The project is a web-based dashboard built using **Laravel 8** and **MySQL**, which displays employee data per period using interactive charts and dynamic filtering.

---

## âœ… Summary

I have completed all tasks as outlined in the test instructions, including:

- Displaying a chart (bar chart) to show **number of employees per period**
- Enabling dynamic filtering by:
  - Company
  - Division
  - Level
  - Gender  
- Implementing **filter combinations** (e.g., Company + Level)
- Using **AJAX (Fetch API)** to update the chart without page reload
- Using provided **dummy data**, migrations, and seeders

All functionalities were built as requested using Laravel 8 and are fully functional and test-ready.

## ðŸ“Œ Goals

- Develop a dashboard with charts (bar, pie, etc.) showing the **number of employees per period**
- Allow filtering by:
  - Company  
  - Division  
  - Level  
  - Gender  
- Filters can be combined. For example, selecting both Company and Level will return employee data that matches **both** criteria.
- The chart data should update based on selected filters using **AJAX or API call**
